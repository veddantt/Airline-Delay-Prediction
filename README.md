# Airline Delay Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict airline flight delays using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical flight data, weather conditions, and various other influencing factors, the model forecasts the likelihood of flight delays. This can assist airlines in optimizing flight schedules, improving operations, and enhancing passenger experience.

## Features
- Predicts flight delays based on historical flight data
- Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Utilizes machine learning models to train and evaluate the prediction system
- Provides visualizations and insights into delay patterns
- Evaluates model performance using standard metrics

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory analysis (optional)
